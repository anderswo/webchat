Websocket Chat with Python using Autobahn running on Twisted.  
The project is based on the folowing tutorial by Pawel Miech:  
https://pawelmhm.github.io/python/websockets/2016/01/02/playing-with-websockets.html

Because of dependencies to Twisted (see https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) at the moment it only runs under Python 2.
